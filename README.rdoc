DoLater - The task app for procrastinators!

We all get those OMG GOOD IDEA that only seems like it at the moment. Whether it's a idea, task, groupon or "that monitor on sale", these can be really distracting. On the other hand, the important tasks get pushed down and we forget about them... This app is the solution.

Summary: On the index page, only the tasks due today are shown. Next to each is a drop box "Do later: 1 hour, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month". That's it! (for now)

This app will demonstrate all I can do with jquery, Ajax, js and then convert into coffeescript. Later I might get into Angular or EmberJS.
